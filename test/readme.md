# Test of the Discussion Bot
## Automatically
The Github actions run the test automatically on every commit.
The results can be found at [https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-response-bot](https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-response-bot).

## Manually
### Setup
Only needed to run the tests:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Test Data
The `discussions.json.tar.gz` file contains a list of discussion threads (first comment only).
The list got generated with the following cmd:
```bash
for i in {1..10}; do wget "https://api.github.com/repos/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/discussions?per_page=100&page=$i" -O discussions_$i.json; done
```

Afterward I removed the first and last line of each file (remove the `[` and `]`) merged the files and wrap the new one again with `[` and `]`.

The `discussions.json.tar.gz` file gets extracted to `discussions.json` if it does not exist yet.

### Run Tests
If you run the `test.py` script it will generate a HTML page which shows all discussions and the matching responses.
